# circpipeTools

Circpipetools is a collected functions for circRNA analysis in JAVA-based program. It currently provided several scripts for processing 
intermediate files used in [circPipe](), which is a nextflow-based pipeline for circRNA identification and quantification from RNA-seq 
dataset. Functions like matrix collapses, overlap analysis, circRNA annotation, and deduplication were implemented by circpipeTools.
In addition, it support several output of circRNA analysis programs as the input of the function, and the functions could be directly ported by 
adding the parameters in different orders. We believe that the circpipeTool could be a key tools for circRNA analysis in the community.
